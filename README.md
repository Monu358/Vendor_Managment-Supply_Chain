# Vendor_Managment-Supply_Chain
This project addresses the challenge of evaluating vendor performance across key supply chain metrics: - Delivery punctuality (on-time vs early deliveries) - Product quality (rejection rates) - Freight and associated costs.
## Problem Statement
This project addresses the challenge of evaluating vendor performance across key supply chain metrics:
 Delivery punctuality (on-time vs early deliveries)
 Product quality (rejection rates)
 Freight and associated costs

The goal is to identify inefficiencies, reduce costs, and improve quality through data-driven vendor management strategies.

## Tools Used
  SQL Server: For data extraction, transformation, and KPI calculations
  
  Power BI  : For interactive dashboards and trend analysis
  
  Canva     : For visual storytelling and summary infographics

## Solution Overview
-  Calculated vendor-level KPIs: on-time delivery rates, average freight cost, and rejection percentages
-  Built Power BI dashboards to visualize trends and compare vendor performance
-  Identified underperforming vendors and cost inefficiencies
-  Recommended focusing procurement on high-performing vendors and negotiating improvements with lower-tier ones
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data-driven vendor management can significantly enhance supply chain efficiency. By analyzing key performance indicators—such as on-time delivery rates, average freight costs, and product rejection percentages—we identified top-performing vendors and flagged underperformers for review.
